## Dice Roller 
This assignment was not to hard to figure out. I was able to find the code, which is a simple loop with a range. My main problem came when I was trying to upload my code to github. The terminal said it was updated but nothing showed up on my actual page. This was easily fixed by just making sure the code was committed, pulled, then pushed.

This assignment was a definetely more complicated than the last assignment. I was finally able to upload things to github without problems.
