# Pi-Assignments

## Dice Roller 
This assignment was not to hard to figure out. I was able to find the code, which is a simple loop with a range. My main problem came when I was trying to upload my code to github. The terminal said it was updated but nothing showed up on my actual page. This was easily fixed by just making sure the code was committed, pulled, then pushed. 

## Calculator 
This assignment was a definetely more complicated than the last assignment. I was finally able to upload things to github without problems. 

## Quadratic Solver 
This assignment was harder for me. I had a couple of simple syntax errors that took a little while to figure out. I had a lot of the indentation wrong initially which was messing up my code. I was able to use google to help with the quadratic solver part which wasn't too bad. I just need to make sure to read everything over. 

## Strings and Loops
This assignment was not terribly complicated. The code was short and simple. I keep having this thing when uploading where is makes me confirm the merge which I am not quite sure of. It hasn't caused any issues but I don't know why it is asking me to do that. 

## MSP
This assignment had us make a hangman game. In my game I made it so the computer already had words and would select a random one to play. This code took me a while. It was hard to figure out and there were many different pieces. The hardest part was making sure to account for all the pieces within the game. Especially the different arrays. One problem I ran into was figuring out how to end the game. If the word was guessed the game din't end. I fixed this by adding winLose statement to end the game if you ran out of tries or guessed the word. 

## GPIO Pins - Bash
This assignment had us get an LED to blink 10 times using bash. I really don't like using bash it is kinda confusing and I think python is easier to code on. I also completly forgot how to wire things so that took a little while to figure out. 

## GPIO Pins - Python
This assignment wasn't too bad I was able to find the code at the website linked below. It's called bash.py cause I messes up a little so when looking for the code look for that.

## GPIO Pins - SSH


## GPIO Pins - I2C
This assingment was kinda complicated. At the beginning the main problem I ran into was getting my screen to work. I don't think it is working sinc enothing is showing up and everytime I run code nothing comes up. I have checked the wires a couple of times so I don't think that is the problem. I followed the instructions and got to the address and yet nothing comes up. I tried running someone elses code and it says it goes through but then nothing shows up. So I don't know what the issue is. I committed the code I used from @pguiffr62 and changed the address to see if anything happened and its still didn't work. I uploaded the code I used but don't know how to proceed without the working OLED screen.
