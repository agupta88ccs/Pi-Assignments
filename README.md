# Pi-Assignments

## Dice Roller 
This assignment was not to hard to figure out. I was able to find the code, which is a simple loop with a range. My main problem came when I was trying to upload my code to github. The terminal said it was updated but nothing showed up on my actual page. This was easily fixed by just making sure the code was committed, pulled, then pushed. 

## Calculator 
This assignment was a definetely more complicated than the last assignment. I was finally able to upload things to github without problems. 

## Quadratic Solver 
This assignment was harder for me. I had a couple of simple syntax errors that took a little while to figure out. I had a lot of the indentation wrong initially which was messing up my code. I was able to use google to help with the quadratic solver part which wasn't too bad. I just need to make sure to read everything over.
